## Problem Statement: 
Sight and Life is a humanitarian nutrition tank working to innovate in nutrition towards eradicating all forms of malnutrition. The organization requires a platform wherein one can access the statistics of eggs availability across the globe, This platform will be incorporated in the Egghub.org website which is currently live.

- https://www.internationalegg.com/

The following parameters are viewable country-wise on the Maps 
- Number of eggs available per person, per year.
- Number of eggs produced per year in the country (Volume and Value)
- Imports and exports of shell eggs and egg powder per year. 
- Producer price of a single egg (In USD)
